NOTE
############
PCI and Hospital palliative care consult survey should be two different survey
headers. I lose some bundling unity but i avoid sections inside sections and 
the data seems more true to the form.

So it would be 
survey_header = pci
survey_section.name = education and training
survey_section.subheading = the hospital conductns regular pallative...

question.name = physician in service...

which means there is no need for head, full or tail. 
Just have question.full? ?not sure about name.

the section should just be like education and training.
? render one question at a time, give survey section selection page with reminders, allow for 
release choice

T/F is a question_group
a useful question group is like M-S with the times,option groups is for common ranges
only atm i can only see a use for M-S

option_choice then contains the "M-F 9am-5pm", ... these question_choices 
then "M-F 9am = 5pm" and M-F 5pm-9am get all get stored in question_options
along with the question_id so to generate are matrix (and all questions it will be something like)
if option_group == 'M-S' then
    for option_group.queryup(option_choices)

else
    kinda what we already have

that means for the PC coverage / Availability question the question name is On
Site and it uses

the second layer of surey section will be for example, name=education and training
subheading = 6. The hospital conducts regular palliative education for 
department and staff members.  PC education is provided at least 1 hr/year at:

? possible add more characters to surveyseciton name and subheader?

with questions like:

Physician in-service or Medical grand rounds – 2 pts
ER palliative teaching at physician staff meeting – 2 pts
Palliative Critical Care in-service or grand rounds – 2 pts
Nursing PC education at in-services or dept. meetings – 2 pts
Social work department meeting or educational session – 2 pts
#
load user
load organization
    load survey head
        load survey section RECURSIVE SURVEY SECTION
            for user packages
                if user_package .. linked with organization
                    user_instruction store user id



make data
check user_survey_sections for most recent completed on datetime
    check user id
    check answers with user id.... something something

when user answer
create answer instance with user_id and question_option_id
question_option_id will contain info about what was selected and question_id
for most this will be True or False
but for M-S it will be ... M-F 9am blah blah
the question_id will link back how many points
it will contain some redudent info if the question choice was True or False
but this is necessary in the case where you have the M-S


Don't need tail and head.
