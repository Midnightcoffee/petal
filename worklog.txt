use heroku logs
(09:36:25 PM) pearkes: midnightcoffee is this for env variables?
(09:37:08 PM) midnightcoffee: pearkes, yes. I'm trying to figure out how to keep my "SECRET_KEY" (from flask) ... secret
(09:37:40 PM) pearkes: midnightcoffee heroku config:add SECRET_KEY=yoursecretkey
(09:37:52 PM) pearkes: that sets it in the app and keeps it out of git!
(09:53:46 PM) midnightcoffee: I need a flask/heroku mentor it seems. That worked after i commented out the from_env part as well.
(09:53:56 PM) pearkes: midnightcoffee cool!
(09:54:21 PM) pearkes: I recommend doing env variables something like this: https://github.com/pearkes/lyre/blob/master/settings.py
(09:54:43 PM) pearkes: You can then add defaults, for example, on the port
(09:54:58 PM) pearkes: So if the port doesn't exist in the env, it defaults to 5000 (for development)
(09:57:49 PM) midnightcoffee: pearkes, is that possible because of how heroku works?
(09:58:27 PM) pearkes: midnightcoffee Nope, that's just the python .get() method. Its defaults to None if there isn't a default set.
(09:58:35 PM) pearkes: Heroku automatically sets a env variable called PORT
(09:59:02 PM) pearkes: So when it runs os.environ.get('PORT', 5000), it just gets the value of the PORT in the env.
(09:59:13 PM) midnightcoffee: pearkes: oh, thats brilliant.
(09:59:19 PM) pearkes: But on development, you'd probably not have that env variable, so it would fall back to 5000

use multiple procfiles
(01:46:30 PM) pearkes: midnightcoffee guinicorn is an http server - usually overkill for development. It also doesn't have flask's (werkzeugs, really) awesome built-in debugger
(01:46:41 PM) pearkes: If I were you
(01:46:45 PM) pearkes: I would make two procfiles
(01:46:48 PM) pearkes: one called Procfile
(01:46:52 PM) pearkes: For Heroku
(01:46:52 PM) maletor [~maletor@c-69-181-24-86.hsd1.ca.comcast.net] entered the room.
(01:47:00 PM) pearkes: and one called Procfile.dev
(01:47:17 PM) pearkes: in Procfile.dev you can put web: python app.py for example
(01:47:31 PM) pearkes: and then locally, run this:
(01:47:42 PM) pearkes: foreman start --procfile Procfile.dev

Updated app to have a link img, changed title
Learned about environment variables, virtualenvwrapper hooks, flask
production vs development.

2012-10-26
Updated app to have a click-able sections linking to (possible) graphs. As
well as the ability to pass values from view to view using sessions. Possible,
will be replaced by a database next.
